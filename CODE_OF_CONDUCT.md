## 501st Troop Tracker Contributor Covenant

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free and productive experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

* **Be Welcoming and Inclusive:** Treat all members of the community with respect. Remember that diverse backgrounds bring diverse solutions.
* **Be Purpose-Driven:** Focus on the mission and the work at hand. Be respectful of others' time and attention.
* **Be Constructive:** Provide feedback that is helpful, well-reasoned, and focused on code or process, not the person. Kindly accept and provide constructive criticism.
* **Be Patient:** Remember, we're all volunteers here. Recognize that mistakes happen and be willing to help correct them.
* **Be Respectful of Decisions:** While disagreement is healthy, we ask that you respect the decisions of the project maintainers, particularly regarding design choices, scope, and direction.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment.
* Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces (GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, discussion boards) and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Representing the project includes using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

### Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

If a contributor engages in behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, the maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, temporary ban, permanent ban, or rejection of contributions (Pull Requests, comments, issues).

### Reporting Violations

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it immediately to the project lead, **Matt Drennan**, by email at **[MAINTAINER_EMAIL_ADDRESS]** (***Note: Please fill in the correct email address for Matt Drennan here***).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
