<h3>I cannot login / I forgot my password</h3>
<p>
    The Troop Tracker has been integrated with the boards. You must use your '.garrison.' boards username and password
    to login to Troop Tracker. To recover your password, use password recovery on the '.garrison.' forum. If you
    continue to have issues logging into your account, your '.garrison.' forum username, may not match the Troop Tracker
    records. Contact the '.garrison.' Webmaster or post a help thread on the forums to get this corrected.
</p>

<h3>I am missing troop data / My troop data is incorrect</h3>
<p>
    Please refer to your squad leader to get this corrected.
</p>

<h3>I am now a member of another club and need access to their costumes.</h3>
<p>
    Please refer to your squad / club leader to get added to the roster.
</p>

<h3>My costumes are not showing on my profile / I am missing a costume on my profile</h3>
<p>
    The troop tracker automatically scrapes several different club databases for your costume data. If your costume data
    is not showing, make sure your ID numbers and forum username\'s are accurate. If the aforementioned information is
    correct, than refer to your squad / club leadership, as this data is missing on their end.
</p>

<h3>How do I know I confirmed a troop?</h3>
<p>
    The troop will be listed on your troop tracker profile, or under your stats on the troop tracker page. When you
    confirm a troop, your status will change from "Going" to "Attended".
</p>

<h3>I need a costume added to the troop tracker.</h3>
<p>
    Please notify your squad leader, or e-mail the Garrison Web Master directly. See below for e-mail.
