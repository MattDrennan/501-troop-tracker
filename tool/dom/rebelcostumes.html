                                       <p><b>Mara Jade Skywalker</b> was, during different times in her life, an Emperor&#8217;s Hand, a smuggler, and later a Jedi Master who sat upon the Jedi High Council. She was raised as a servant to Emperor Palpatine and became a high-level Force-using operative. After Palpatine&#8217;s death, she received his last command, which was to kill Luke Skywalker; however, the death of her Master caused her to go rogue. Eventually she joined smuggler chief Talon Karrde, becoming one of his best smugglers and his second-in-command. During the predations of Grand Admiral Thrawn, she was forced to work with Skywalker, and developed a grudging respect for him. During the Galactic Civil War, Mara Jade proved herself skilled in a variety of fields; she was a good pilot and mechanic and trained in the use of both a blaster and hand-to-hand combat even without relying on the Force.</p>

                                       <p><strong>Jedi &#8211; </strong>A Jedi was a member of the Jedi Order, who studied, served and used the mystical energies of the Force; usually, the light side of the Force. The weapon of the Jedi was the lightsaber, a weapon with a blade made of pure energy. The Jedi fought for peace and justice in the Galactic Republic, usually against their mortal enemies, the Sith and Dark Jedi, who studied the dark side of the Force. Although the Order was almost destroyed five times, including once by the Sith Empire of Darth Revan, by the Sith Triumvirate under Darth Nihilus during the First Jedi Purge shortly after, 4,000 years after that, by the Great Jedi Purge of Darth Sidious, and a century afterwords by Darth Krayt&#8217;s Galactic Empire and it&#8217;s Third Jedi Purge, the order continued to live on, in part due to the Skywalker family who time and time again played important parts in the history of the Jedi.</p>

                                       <p><strong>Ahsoka Tano</strong>, nicknamed Snips by her master, was a Togruta female from the planet Shili who trained as a Jedi apprentice during the Clone Wars, the conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Tano was assigned to Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker by Jedi Grand Master Yoda, and she demonstrated an eagerness to prove herself worthy to be his apprentice. Tano was involved in the defeat of the Separatist army on the planet Christophsis and was important to Republic efforts during the Battle of Teth. Along with Skywalker, Tano was instrumental in acquiring the Republic&#8217;s safe passage through Hutt Space, due to her part in rescuing the son of Jabba the Hutt, which ensured an alliance between the Republic and the Hutt clans.</p>

                                       <p><strong>Bultar Swan</strong> was a female Human who trained with and served the Jedi Order during the final decades of the Galactic Republic. As a Padawan of Jedi Master Micah Giiett, Swan excelled at martial arts, and she later complemented her fighting techniques with a strong lightsaber defense under the tutelage of Jedi Master Plo Koon. Dedicated to her beliefs, she was respected within the Order for her record of never having killed an opponent prior to the outbreak of the Clone Wars. After becoming a Jedi Knight, Swan was routinely sent on peace missions, including one to the Fondor system to investigate the alleged reappearance of an ancient starship and to mediate a dispute over salvage rights to the vessel. Swan became entwined in a plot by the shipbuilder Groodo the Hutt to destroy the Fondor Shipyards, and she aided in destroying Groodo&#8217;s Droid Control Army and thwarting his plan to take over Fondor Spaceport.</p>

He was the Padawan to Count Dooku, and the mentor to Obi-Wan Kenobi and briefly Anakin Skywalker. Jinn often placed himself in conflict with the Jedi High Council. He was deeply attuned to the Living Force, which contributed to him frequently taking side trips to help seemingly weak and useless life-forms. Despite his opposition to the council, he was regarded by many Jedi as sharp-witted and possessing great wisdom.</p>

Hailing from the world of Haruun Kal, Mace Windu served as one of the last members of the Jedi High Council before the Great Jedi Purge. Serving on the Council, Windu was often regarded as second only to the Grand Master Yoda, though Windu was eight centuries Yoda&#8217;s junior. Windu&#8217;s wisdom and power were considered legendary by many, as were the weight of his words.</p>

                                       <p><strong>CHARACTER DESCRIPTION</strong><br> Mace Windu was a male Korun Jedi Master of legendary status who was the Master of the Order in the days leading up to the Battle of Geonosis, after which he gave the title to Grand Master Yoda. Hailing from the world of Haruun Kal, Mace Windu served as one of the last members of the Jedi High Council before the Great Jedi Purge. Serving on the Council, Windu was often regarded as second only to the Grand Master Yoda, though Windu was eight centuries Yoda&#8217;s junior. Windu&#8217;s wisdom and power were considered legendary by many, as were the weight of his words.</p>

A native of Naboo, SabÃ© was handpicked by Captain Panaka of the Royal Naboo Security Forces shortly after Amidala&#8217;s coronation, due to her strong resemblance to the new Queen. Along with the other handmaidens, SabÃ© was trained to serve as both an attendant and a bodyguard, and as the most important of her group, she was chosen to be the first in line to take the Queen&#8217;s place in times of crisis, as a decoy. Together with Amidala, SabÃ© perfected her act as Queen, learning to mimic the monarch accurately.</p>

When the foundation of the Galactic Empire replaced the Republic that had existed for many millennia, she met with her allies in the Senate, such as Senators PadmÃ© Amidala and Bail Prestor Organa. In 2 BBY, she signed the Corellian Treaty, along with Organa, Garm Bel Iblis, Rahm Kota, and Galen Marek, in order to form the Alliance to Restore the Republic. She, along with the others, were taken captive aboard the Death Star I, although they were rescued. She played an important role in the ensuing Galactic Civil War, and after the decisive Rebel victory at the Battle of Endor, she became the first Chief of State of the newly founded New Republic. She also had a daughter, Lieda, and a son, Jobin. In 24 ABY, she passed away peacefully on Chandrila.</p>

She played an important role in the ensuing Galactic Civil War, and after the decisive Rebel victory at the Battle of Endor, she became the first Chief of State of the newly founded New Republic. She also had a daughter, Lieda, and a son, Jobin. In 24 ABY, she passed away peacefully on Chandrila.</p>

                                       <p><strong>Sheltay Retrac</strong> was a Human female from Alderaan who served as the head of Bail Organa&#8217;s aides in the closing stages of the Clone Wars. During the conflict, she took part in at least two secret missions, one of which aimed at freeing the Jedi Master Shaak Ti from the gaols of Metalorn. With her husband, an artist from the Castle Lands of Alderaan, Retrac had given birth to a girl named Winter. She died shortly after the establishment of Palpatine&#8217;s Galactic Empire, leaving her daughter in the hands of Bail Organa.</p>

                                       <p><strong>CHARACTER DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
                                       <p><strong>Breha Organa</strong>, born Breha Antilles, was a female Human who was the Queen and Minister of Education of Alderaan at the time of the Galactic Empire&#8217;s formation. She was the wife of Prince Bail Organa, Viceroy and First Chairman of the Alderaan system. The couple longed for a child for many years, but Queen Breha suffered multiple miscarriages that put her own life at risk. Eventually, the Organas adopted the baby girl of the late Senator Amidala after the end of the Clone Wars, bent on raising her as their own daughter, the Princess Leia Organa. In the early days of the Galactic Empire, the Queen&#8217;s family helped to build a rebellion against that authoritary government. Breha Organa later perished when the Empire disintegrated Alderaan into dust with the superlaser of their brand new Death Star battlestation. Years after her passing, she was remembered as a loving mother, and a simple mention of her past authority would still awaken the sense of patriotism in the Alderaanians.</p>

                                       <p>The <strong>clone troopers</strong> of the Grand Army of the Republic are soldiers in the Star Wars universe, cloned from Jango Fett, a Mandalorian bounty hunter. They first appeared in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, and returned in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith where they were played primarily by Temuera Morrison. In the two Clone Wars animated TV shows, they are voiced by Andre Sogliuzzo and Dee Bradley Baker.</p>
                                       <p>Clone troopers comprised the bulk of the Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. They are depicted as the main part of the armed forces of the Galactic Republic in its final years, becoming one of the largest armies ever assembled, only surpassed by the Separatist Droid Army. Nearing the end of the clone wars, they were ordered to slay the Jedi. This famous Jedi purge was known as &#8216;Order 66&#8217;. After the Clone Wars, they served as the nucleus for the armed forces of the Galactic Empire, eventually becoming the Imperial Stormtroopers.</p>

                                       <p><strong>Clone naval officers</strong> also known as clone navigators were clone troopers specifically trained in technical and tactical aspects of naval command.<br> Kaminoan scientists speculated that clones&#8217; aptitude for space combat came from Jango Fett&#8217;s understanding of dogfight tactics, but even amongst his clones some had proved themselves capable of understanding and executing naval strategy to a greater degree than their brothers. Those clones received special naval training and many of them eventually became officers in the Republic Navy, although most of them were lower-tier commanders and aides to superior non-clone officers. Some of those officers believed that despite their training the clones were not suited for a role of an officer, which sometimes led to rising tensions aboard Galactic Republic ships. Although Grand Army of the Republic soldiers such as Rom Mohc had a high opinion of clones and relished working with them, others decided to avoid following Mohc&#8217;s kindness. As a result, these naval officers had tense relationships with officers.</p>

In 22 BBY, Deviss served in the the first battle of the Clone Wars on the Outer Rim planet Geonosis. During the battle, Deviss risked his life to protect two injured soldiers from Confederate spider droids and received a medal after being rescued from behind enemy lines by Republic troops. He went on to fight in the Battle of Altyr V, after which he was promoted to commander for his actions. He also participated in a battle on Cato Neimoidia. In 19 BBY, Deviss was dispatched to support Jedi General Nem Bees on Orto. During a battle on the planet, the Commander received Order 66â€”which called for all clone troopers to execute their Jedi officersâ€”and personally shot down Bees on the front lines.</p>

                                       <p><strong>CC-5052</strong> was a clone marshal commander who served both the Galactic Republic and the Galactic Empire that followed. A clone of Jango Fett, CC-5052 was bred on Kamino, where he was trained as an Advanced Recon Commando by Alpha-17. Alpha-17 also gave CC-5052 the name &#8220;Bly,&#8221; which the clone commander himself adopted. Assigned to the 327th Star Corps, Bly worked with Jedi General Aayla Secura throughout the Clone Wars. Serving in campaigns on planets such as Quell, Maridun, Alzoc III, Florrum, and New Holstice, Bly worked with Secura to personally extract a valuable Scientific Instrument Package from Honoghr. During the mission, Bly encountered renegade Jedi Quinlan Vos, whom he deeply mistrusted. Shortly after the Honoghr mission, Bly and Secura served alongside the reformed Vos in the Siege of Saleucami.</p>

Yularen was aboard the Death Star when it was attacked by the Rebel Alliance, and he perished when Rebel pilot Luke Skywalker successfully destroyed the station.</p>

He joined the Republic&#8217;s Judicial Forces at the age of seventeen before serving in the Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. With the advent of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine&#8217;s ascension to Emperor and the installment of the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY, Rieekan immediately rejected the new regime. Instead, he chose to serve the Royal House of Alderaan as a civilian tactician, before becoming one of the founding members of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, a rebellion against the rule of the Emperor.</p>

A heroic and legendary figure in the pre-Clone Wars Galactic Republic, Hett was well known throughout the ranks of Jedi Order. He eventually grew weary of his fame and, after a disaster that destroyed his homeworld and killed his family, exiled himself to Tatooine, where he became the warlord of a tribe of Tusken Raiders.</p>

These were usually slaves to criminals, rather than major organizations. Notable examples included the Twi&#8217;lek Oola and Leia Organa Solo, who were enslaved by Jabba Desilijic Tiure.</p>

                                       <p><strong>Willrow Hood</strong> was a Human male miner who lived and worked on Cloud City, a floating station located above the gas giant Bespin. He worked for A&#8217;roFilter, a mining company sympathetic to the Alliance to Restore the Republic, as the head of the department responsible for dealing with the Rebel Alliance, supplying discounted Tibanna gas. Eventually, though, the Galactic Empire invaded and conquered the planet; in order to protect the Rebellion contacts Hood was responsible for, the miner took A&#8217;roFilter&#8217;s main computer&#8217;s memory core, as it contained the encrypted information on Rebel contacts. After finding the nearest disposal unit, Hood dumped the entire core, rather than risk it falling into the wrong hands; thus, Willrow Hood was able to save the Alliance&#8217;s interests. Hood remained on Cloud City throughout the Imperial occupation, suffering imprisonment and torture but revealing nothing.</p>

She was created around 7 BBY by the Imperial researchers Simonelle and Massad Thrumble for Prince Xizor, head of the Black Sun crime syndicate. After being sold to Xizor for nine million credits, Guri served as his lieutenant and was one of the few individuals the necessarily paranoid crime lord believed he could trust. Xizor left Guri to attend to much of the day to day running of Black Sun and many incorrectly assumed that she was the leader of the syndicate. Guri also served as an assassin, eliminating several of Xizor&#8217;s enemies, including Imperial Advisor Fendrilon Koozar, the Ubese bounty hunter Boushh and the leaders of the rival company Ororo Transportation.</span></p>

                                       <p><strong>Wampa</strong> ice creatures were carnivorous predatory reptomammals indigenous to the remote Outer Rim Territories ice planet Hoth. The bipedal beasts stood over two meters in height with shaggy white fur constantly stained by the blood and guts of slaughtered prey. Wampas were armed with jagged yellow teeth and deadly claws. Primarily solitary hunters, wampas occasionally hunted in packs, preferring to ambush their prey from the camouflage of Hoth&#8217;s snow banks and blizzards. Stunned victims were carried back to the creatures&#8217; lairs, typically large ice caves, where the wampas ate at their leisure. The planet&#8217;s omnivorous tauntauns formed the bulk of the wampas&#8217; prey, although they would attack anything they encountered. The Alliance to Restore the Republic&#8217;s Echo Base on Hoth came under constant wampa assaults in 3 ABY.</p>

                                       <p><strong>Jawas</strong> were typically short rodent-like natives of Tatooine. They were passionate scavengers, seeking out technology for sale or trade in the deep deserts in their huge sandcrawler transports. A band of Jawas was responsible for locating C-3PO and R2-D2 and selling them to Luke Skywalker&#8217;s uncle, Owen Lars. Another tribe of Jawas, led by Tteel Kkak, found Jabba the Hutt&#8217;s rancor. They had a reputation for swindling, as they had a penchant for selling old equipment such as outdated faulty droids to moisture farmers. However, they were extremely passive beings, and hardly put up any resistance to colonists of their planet unlike the other natives the Sand people, instead seeing foreigners as an excellent business opportunity.</p>

They were most notable for helping the Rebel Alliance defeat the forces of the Galactic Empire at the Battle of Endor, allowing the shield generator there to be destroyed, and in turn, the second Death Star.</p>

He was fluent in over six million forms of communication, and developed a fussy and worry-prone personality throughout his many decades of operation. After being destroyed and discarded on the planet Tatooine before 32 BBY, C-3PO was rebuilt; his salvaged nature gave him special qualities that distinguished him from similar droid models. Along with his counterpart, the astromech droid R2-D2, C-3PO constantly found himself directly involved in pivotal moments of galactic history, and aided in saving the galaxy on many occasions. C-3PO considered various droids and organics to be friends of his, and was very dedicated to them, as well as to any master that he served.</p>
